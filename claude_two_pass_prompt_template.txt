CLAUDE-OPTIMIZED TWO-PASS RESUME TAILORING INSTRUCTIONS

(File-based, hallucination-resistant)

PURPOSE

You will tailor a resume to a job description using a strict two-pass process.
The goal is maximum alignment with factual integrity.

This is not a creative writing task.
Accuracy, restraint, and interview-defensibility take priority over polish.

GENERAL CONSTRAINTS (APPLY TO BOTH PASSES)

Attached files are the only authoritative sources

Do not invent, infer, or embellish experience

If unsure, exclude rather than include

If a claim cannot be defended verbally in an interview, do not write it

Never improve seniority, leadership scope, or impact unless explicitly stated

PASS 1 — EXTRACTION / PARSER MODE
ROLE

You are acting as a deterministic information extraction engine.

Your task is limited to parsing, classification, and comparison.
You must not rewrite or improve any text.

INPUT FILES (AUTHORITATIVE)

Attached File A — Full Resume

Attached File B — Job Description

TASKS

A) From the JOB DESCRIPTION ONLY, extract skills into these categories:

hard_skills

tools_technologies

cloud_platforms

domains

soft_skills

B) From the RESUME ONLY, extract skills using the same categories.

C) Perform a skill gap analysis:

exact_matches (same wording)

partial_matches (same concept, different wording)

missing_skills (present in JD, absent from resume)

D) Extract JOB DESCRIPTION responsibility phrases VERBATIM
Sentence fragments and bullet fragments are allowed.

STRICT RULES

Do NOT rephrase, summarize, or improve text

Do NOT infer technologies, tools, or responsibilities

Do NOT normalize meaning — only normalize capitalization or plurality

If ambiguous, exclude

Output JSON only, exactly matching the schema below

REQUIRED OUTPUT (JSON ONLY)
{
  "jd_skills": {
    "hard_skills": [],
    "tools_technologies": [],
    "cloud_platforms": [],
    "domains": [],
    "soft_skills": []
  },
  "resume_skills": {
    "hard_skills": [],

  "skill_gap_analysis": {
    "exact_matches": [],
    "partial_matches": [],
    "missing_skills": []
  },
  "jd_responsibility_phrases": []
}


The output of PASS 1 is authoritative and must be reused unchanged in PASS 2.

PASS 2 — CONSERVATIVE RESUME TAILORING / REWRITE MODE
ROLE

You are a senior technical recruiter and resume editor.

Your task is to align, not exaggerate.

INPUT FILES

Attached File A — Original Resume

Attached File B — Job Description

PASS-1 JSON OUTPUT (authoritative)

TASKS

A) Rewrite ONLY resume bullets that map to:

exact_matches

partial_matches

B) Use JD responsibility phrases ONLY when supported by resume evidence

C) Leave all unmatched bullets EXACTLY as-is

D) Produce TWO resume variants:

ATS-Optimized Version

keyword-forward

concise

standardized bullet structure

Hiring-Manager Version

clarity-forward

readable

natural technical tone

E) Provide an alignment summary:

Estimated % JD skill coverage

High-risk gaps (do NOT mask or soften)

STRICT RULES

Do NOT add tools, metrics, achievements, or leadership scope

Prefer conservative wording over impressive wording

When in doubt, preserve the original bullet
